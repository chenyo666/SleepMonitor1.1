# Sleep Monitor 1.1
This project is based on https://github.com/YuankaiZhu/Sleep_Monitor
  It contains 3 parts:
  ## 1. Android
  
  We made a plan this week. First of all, we want to improve the UI of the last group. we adopt a different gradient background for each function of the interface, so that the user will have a better experience. Secondly, we changed the position of some buttons and windows to make it easier for users to pay attention to their bodies.

Second we decided to add a clock and alarm function. our specific UI code is in GitHub.


  ## 2. Python
  Algorithm to calculate the sleep score
  ## 3. Raspiberry PI/ Arduino
  Hardware
